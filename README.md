## How to create action in github:
To create a GitHub Action, you can follow these steps:
1. Navigate to your GitHub repository in which you want to create the Action.
2. Go to the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository.
3. Click on the "New workflow" button, or if it's your first time, you might see a template to choose from (Node.js).
4. You'll be directed to the workflow file editor, where you can define the workflow using YAML syntax.
5. Provide a name for your workflow file, such as main.yml.
6. Define the event that triggers the workflow. This could be a push to the repository, a pull request, or a scheduled event, among others.
7. Specify the jobs and steps that make up your workflow. Jobs represent the work that needs to be done, and steps define the individual tasks within each job.
8. Configure the desired actions to be performed within each step. You can use pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace or create your own custom actions.
9. Customize and configure each action with relevant inputs, outputs, and settings as needed.
10. Save the workflow file.
11. GitHub will automatically validate the syntax of your workflow file and enable the workflow.
12. The workflow will now run based on the triggers you defined, and you can view the execution logs and status in the "Actions" tab.
By following these steps, you can create a GitHub Action and automate various tasks within your repository.
